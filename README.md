# CrimeReport
## Project Description
The project is about analyzing Campus Crime Data of more than 50 Universities across 20+ cities all over US in order to help students choose universities by providing more insights of campus crime.
## Project Overview
Universities are spending millions on ineffective campus security initiatives 
Students do not have a reliable and centralized resource to assess the security of a region where they will be attending school
People are not aware of the correlation between state laws and the prevalent crime rate
